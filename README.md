# Duck Shoot Lotto

The purpose of the game is to select six numbers from a possible range of 1 to 49. These
numbers can subsequently be entered into a lottery or a fixed-bet lotto run by another
company. The numbers are randomly applied to ducks and the player needs to "shoot" the
ducks are they appear. The "shot must be exactly in the centre of the duck for the number
to be selected.
